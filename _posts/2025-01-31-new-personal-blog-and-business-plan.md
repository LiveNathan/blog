Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

(shit, already off to a bad start. i don't think i'm supposed to use yellow emojis anymore.)

Greetings! ðŸ¦–

(never mind, just checked with my wife, turns out yellow's ok again)

Welcome! ðŸ¦¦

A quick note on how these posts are written: I typically do a stream-of-consciousness brain dump (usually via dictation), then work with Claude (Anthropic's AI) to organize and structure the content before my final edits. It makes writing more enjoyable for me and hopefully creates a better reading experience for you. I'm mentioning this upfront since I know AI assistance can be controversial for some readers.

Why start another blog? A few reasons:

1. Personal journal and accountability for my next business venture
2. Public documentation to help clarify my own thoughts
3. Maybe it helps someone else on a similar journey
4. Support and feedback from others building in public

Why Substack? Honestly, laziness. I couldn't decide on the tech stack for nathanlively.com's blog, and Sound Design Live hasn't felt like the right place while exploring beyond audio. These posts will focus on business but include insights about software development (Java, Vaadin, Spring, TDD, Hexagonal Architecture) and life (hot chocolate, ACIM, movies).

## Building a Profitable Micro-SaaS Through Directory-First Validation

After years of building products in the live sound space, I'm embarking on a focused 5-month journey to establish a profitable micro-SaaS business. This post outlines my strategy, learnings from past ventures, and concrete plan for the months ahead.

### The Plan

I'm dedicating the next 5 months (through July 1, 2025) to rapidly launching and testing multiple directory websites while developing a keyword research tool. The goal: identify real market demand through observed behavior rather than just customer interviews.

### Core Strategy

1. Launch 5 directories in rapid succession (targeting 3-5 weeks total)
2. Use real traffic and engagement data to validate opportunities
3. Develop products based on observed user behavior and needs
4. Focus on B2B problems with clear ROI potential

### Why Directories?

1. **Launch fast!** Directories are one of the fastest things to launch that can deliver real value and get feedback. Ever since I read The 7 Day Startup years ago I've dreamed of actually finding something I could launch quickly like this. Hopefully this is the answer.

2. **Abandon my clever ideas.** I've spent years working on projects that I thought were important or special or revolutionary. No one cared. Personal demand â‰  market demand. I need a process that focuses on discovering real market demand.
