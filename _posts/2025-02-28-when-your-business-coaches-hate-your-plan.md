Hello, fellow human! ðŸ¦¦

Remember that ambitious 5-month plan I shared last month about launching 5 directory websites that would somehow
magically transform into a profitable business? Well... that didn't happen. Instead, I had what might be described as a
month-long pity party (possibly a midlife crisis).

## A Quick Recap of My Original Plan

For those who missed my previous post, my ambitious 5-month plan involved rapidly launching 5 directory websites by July
2025. The strategy was to use these directories as market validation tools rather than end products themselves. Instead
of relying on customer interviews, I wanted to observe real user behavior and engagement to identify genuine market
needs.

Each directory would serve as a testing ground to uncover pain points and opportunities within specific niches. Once I
identified areas with demonstrated demand, I planned to develop more comprehensive solutions (likely SaaS products) to
address those needs. The key insight was that directories could be launched quickly with minimal investment while still
delivering real value to usersâ€”making them perfect for validation.

I was excited about this approach because it would allow me to abandon my own "clever ideas" that nobody cared about,
and instead focus on discovering actual market demand through observable user behavior. Unfortunately, as you'll read,
this plan ran into some significant obstacles when I sought expert feedback.

## When the Experts Say No

Here's what went down: I met with two highly successful business coaches â€“ and I mean genuinely successful people who've
built multiple thriving businesses before doing any coaching. I figured getting dual perspectives would be smart. I'd
also tried to book a third coach, but at $500/hour, it felt financially irresponsible for someone who's essentially
pre-revenue.

After putting several days into refining my business plan (the one I proudly summarized in my last post), I was feeling
pretty confident. Then came the unanimous verdict from both coaches.

One put it bluntly: **"The world does not need another directory website."**

Ouch. ðŸ˜£

## The Almost-Midlife Crisis

That feedback kicked off what felt like a midlife crisis. I might have gone off to buy an expensive sports car or tried
to get double wifed up if it weren't for my daily ACIM practice.

When I feel this level of disappointment, my first instinct is to burn everything down â€“ delete all websites, nuke my
YouTube videos, and disappear into the digital ether. Instead, I took a break and immersed myself in ACIM. I restarted
the workbook lessons for probably the fourth or fifth time, but this time, something was different.

There's something about pain that heightens awareness. Most days, my mind wanders endlessly â€“ thinking about tasks,
problems, when I can eat again, watch a movie, or devour chocolate. But this time, the sadness brought with it an edge
of awareness. From second to second, I was genuinely observing my thoughts and experiencing the present moment more
authentically than ever before.

It seemed like the perfect time to restart the workbook lessons. I've been doing them daily, supplemented with Kenneth
Wapnick's analysis, and I'm seeing the mind training work on a whole new level.

## Slowly Finding My Way Back

After about a week of feeling absolutely terrible and doing nothing productive, things started to ease. I began
wondering what to do with my time since my five-month plan had evaporated.

I cautiously dipped my toes back into work:

1. **Updates to my [keyword research app](https://www.b2bdemandgenerationstrategy.com/)**: I added three different API
   endpoints for keyword sourcing, which means you now get thousands of potential keywords to filter instead of just a
   few hundred. Fewer bugs too! (It's title is "B2B Demand Generation Strategy" but honestly, who has time for that
   mouthful? It's the keyword research app.)

2. **Escaped the Minnesota winter**: I visited friends and family in Texas, which was refreshing. Pro tip: Visit Texas
   in winter instead of summer. Trading the ten-minute Minnesota ritual of layering protective gear just to collect mail
   for the simplicity of "throw on a coat and go" was liberating.

Here's an expanded section about your keyword research app that provides more context while remaining concise:

## Updates to My Keyword Research App

For those who've been following along, I made significant improvements to
my [keyword research app](https://www.b2bdemandgenerationstrategy.com/) (yes, it's formally called "B2B Demand
Generation Strategy," but that's quite a mouthful, so I typically just call it the keyword research app).

The most substantial update is that keywords are now sourced from three different API endpoints instead of just one.
This means when you conduct research, you'll potentially get thousands of keyword results to filter through rather than
just a few hundred. I've also squashed several bugs that were causing frustration.

The app was originally designed to help directory builders save time by analyzing content sources (like Reddit) to
uncover hidden demand, validating directory-worthy keywords based on search volume and competition, and keeping research
organized. It's been especially helpful for people like Mark, a software engineer who's building multiple directories as
side projects while working full-time.

I've been contemplating changes to the pricing model too. Currently, it
costs $20 per research session, but I recently read an article suggesting that most users dislike credit-based pricing for AI-powered applications. The recommendation was to implement progressive pricing insteadâ€”essentially letting users consume the service first and then pay for it. For example, let them use $
1 worth of credit, then pay for it, then use $10 and pay for that, and so on. This seems like a more user-friendly
approach that I might implement in the future.

If you're working on directory sites or any content that requires keyword validation, it might be worth checking out.
The goal is to help you avoid spending months building something nobody is searching forâ€”a lesson I've learned the hard
way.

## Seeking New Directions

To get motivated, I started reading Noah Kagan's book (which has a silly title). I tend to follow business advice
extremely prescriptively, often mistaking people's strategies for tactics â€“ thinking if I do exactly what they did, I'll
get identical results.

The book starts with exercises to generate business ideas, which I've tried before with limited success. I dutifully
produced about 50 business concepts and ranked them, but the results felt uninspiring. My top idea was an app to help
you finish workouts without crashing from energy depletion (a personal problem â€“ I've never completed all exercises in
my 30-minute training sessions despite 100+ sessions over two years).

While I definitely want a solution to this problem, I couldn't see myself building a business around it. It feels too
disconnected from my current networks and expertise â€“ or maybe that's just my limiting beliefs talking?

## The Power of Asking

One valuable takeaway from the book was the importance of asking others for ideas rather than relying solely on my own "
brilliant" concepts. I've started asking everyone I meet for coffee or lunch if they have business ideas for me.

I even sent that exact question to my mailing list and received an intriguing response: create invoicing software
specifically for audiovisual technicians. This resonated with me, especially since I've recently accepted that it's
perfectly okay to create software that already exists in some form â€“ just like it's okay to open a restaurant that
serves hamburgers despite McDonald's existing.

## The Reddit Reality Check

I spoke with several people, created mockups, and started getting excited. The concept seemed promising â€“
a $100/year solution specifically designed for AV technicians, streamlined and easy to use, positioned between free Google Sheets (manual, time-consuming) and $
400/year QuickBooks (overpowered).

I [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1iux53h/how_do_you_handle_invoicing_for_your_freelance/)
asking AV folks how they currently handle invoicing. The post received significant engagement (15K views and 91 comments
at the time of writing), which initially seemed promising â€“ clearly this was a topic people cared about.

For each person who shared their solution, I asked some variation of: "Is there anything you wish it did differently?"
To my surprise, almost everyone said "no."

The thread revealed a diverse ecosystem of solutions that people are genuinely happy with:

- Several users enthusiastically endorsed **Wave** as "fantastic," "very intuitive," and "significantly cheaper than
  QuickBooks and better in every way"
- Others praised **Square Invoices** for being free, easy to use, and accessible via mobile app
- Some preferred **Excel/Word templates** they've customized over time
- There were mentions of **Zoho Books** (free for a single user with full package including expense tracking)
- A few used **Quickbooks** and felt it was worth the cost for their specific needs
- Several other options appeared: **Harvest**, **Invoice Ninja**, **FreshBooks**, **Express Invoice**, and even
  specialty software for specific countries

What was striking wasn't just the variety of solutions, but how satisfied users were with their current setup. When I
tried to uncover pain points by asking what they'd change, responses included:

- "No. It's pretty powerful and can do way more than I need."
- "Not really. It's not top of the line software by any stretch, but it's absolutely good enough for what I need."
- "Nope. Are you looking to make a competitor?"

This was a massive red flag. How could my initial conversations suggest there's no good solution for AV technicians,
while this broader sample seemed perfectly content with existing options?

Even more telling: the person who originally pitched the idea to me wasn't willing to put down a pre-sale deposit. While
disappointing, I'm grateful for the quick validation (or invalidation) before spending months building something nobody
would buy.

## What's Next?

Honestly, I don't know. I have no new business plan. Maybe I'll continue asking for ideas and validating them, possibly
shooting down one business concept per week until something sticks.

In the meantime, I'm working on:

1. **A new [SubAligner](https://www.subaligner.com/) feature** that analyzes loudspeaker measurements and automatically
   generates alignment solutions.
   This is more of a personal project â€“ something I've wanted to do just to see if it works. It's been fun converting my
   old MATLAB code into Java.

2. **Potentially reviving my audio signal decorrelation project**. I had developed a VST plugin last year but shelved it
   due to limited interest and no pre-sales. Now I'm reconsidering â€“ maybe I could sell it to AV companies, the
   automotive industry, or cinema sound professionals. Many suffer from comb filtering problems introduced by
   destructive interference, and this would be a powerful solution.

## Your Turn

I'm curious: Do you have any business ideas for me? What's one thing that bothered you this morning? What's been on your
to-do list for more than a week? What did you try to buy recently, only to discover it didn't exist?

Leave me a comment or shoot me an email. Your frustrations might be my next opportunity!
