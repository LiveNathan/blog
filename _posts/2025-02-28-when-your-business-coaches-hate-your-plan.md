Hello, fellow human! ðŸ¦¦

Remember that ambitious 5-month plan I shared last month about launching 5 directory websites that would somehow
magically transform into a profitable business? Well... that didn't happen. Instead, I had what might be described as a
month-long pity party (possibly a midlife crisis).

## When the Experts Say No

Here's what went down: I met with two highly successful business coaches â€“ and I mean genuinely successful people who've
built multiple thriving businesses before doing any coaching. I figured getting dual perspectives would be smart. I'd
also tried to book a third coach, but at $500/hour, it felt financially irresponsible for someone who's essentially
pre-revenue.

After putting several days into refining my business plan (the one I proudly summarized in my last post), I was feeling
pretty confident. Then came the unanimous verdict from both coaches.

One put it bluntly: **"The world does not need another directory website."**

Ouch. ðŸ˜£

## The Almost-Midlife Crisis

That feedback kicked off what felt like a midlife crisis. I might have gone off to buy an expensive sports car or tried
to get double wifed up if it weren't for my daily ACIM practice.

When I feel this level of disappointment, my first instinct is to burn everything down â€“ delete all websites, nuke my
YouTube videos, and disappear into the digital ether. Instead, I took a break and immersed myself in ACIM. I restarted
the workbook lessons for probably the fourth or fifth time, but this time, something was different.

There's something about pain that heightens awareness. Most days, my mind wanders endlessly â€“ thinking about tasks,
problems, when I can eat again, watch a movie, or devour chocolate. But this time, the sadness brought with it an edge
of awareness. From second to second, I was genuinely observing my thoughts and experiencing the present moment more
authentically than ever before.

It seemed like the perfect time to restart the workbook lessons. I've been doing them daily, supplemented with Kenneth
Wapnick's analysis, and I'm seeing the mind training work on a whole new level.

## Slowly Finding My Way Back

After about a week of feeling absolutely terrible and doing nothing productive, things started to ease. I began
wondering what to do with my time since my five-month plan had evaporated.

I cautiously dipped my toes back into work:

1. **Updates to my [keyword research app](https://www.b2bdemandgenerationstrategy.com/)**: I added three different API
   endpoints for keyword sourcing, which means you now get thousands of potential keywords to filter instead of just a
   few hundred. Fewer bugs too! (It's title is "B2B Demand Generation Strategy" but honestly, who has time for that
   mouthful? It's the keyword research app.)

2. **Escaped the Minnesota winter**: I visited friends and family in Texas, which was refreshing. Pro tip: Visit Texas
   in winter instead of summer. Trading the ten-minute Minnesota ritual of layering protective gear just to collect mail
   for the simplicity of "throw on a coat and go" was liberating.

## Seeking New Directions

To get motivated, I started reading Noah Kagan's book (which has a silly title). I tend to follow business advice
extremely prescriptively, often mistaking people's strategies for tactics â€“ thinking if I do exactly what they did, I'll
get identical results.

The book starts with exercises to generate business ideas, which I've tried before with limited success. I dutifully
produced about 50 business concepts and ranked them, but the results felt uninspiring. My top idea was an app to help
you finish workouts without crashing from energy depletion (a personal problem â€“ I've never completed all exercises in
my 30-minute training sessions despite 100+ sessions over two years).

While I definitely want a solution to this problem, I couldn't see myself building a business around it. It feels too
disconnected from my current networks and expertise â€“ or maybe that's just my limiting beliefs talking?

## The Power of Asking

One valuable takeaway from the book was the importance of asking others for ideas rather than relying solely on my own "
brilliant" concepts. I've started asking everyone I meet for coffee or lunch if they have business ideas for me.

I even sent that exact question to my mailing list and received an intriguing response: create invoicing software
specifically for audiovisual technicians. This resonated with me, especially since I've recently accepted that it's
perfectly okay to create software that already exists in some form â€“ just like it's okay to open a restaurant that
serves hamburgers despite McDonald's existing.

## The Reddit Reality Check

I spoke with several people, created mockups, and started getting excited. The concept seemed promising â€“
a $100/year solution specifically designed for AV technicians, streamlined and easy to use, positioned between free Google Sheets (manual, time-consuming) and $
400/year QuickBooks (overpowered).

Then
I [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1iux53h/how_do_you_handle_invoicing_for_your_freelance/)
asking AV folks how they currently handle invoicing. I got lots of comments (exciting!), and for each person who shared
their solution, I asked: "Is there anything you wish it did differently?"

To my shock, almost everyone said "no."

This was a massive red flag. How could my initial conversations suggest there's no good solution for AV technicians,
while this broader sample seemed perfectly content with existing options?

Even more telling: the person who originally pitched the idea to me wasn't willing to put down a pre-sale deposit. While
disappointing, I'm grateful for the quick validation (or invalidation) before spending months building something nobody
would buy.

## What's Next?

Honestly, I don't know. I have no new business plan. Maybe I'll continue asking for ideas and validating them, possibly
shooting down one business concept per week until something sticks.

In the meantime, I'm working on:

1. **A new SubAligner feature** that analyzes loudspeaker measurements and automatically generates alignment solutions.
   This is more of a personal project â€“ something I've wanted to do just to see if it works. It's been fun converting my
   old MATLAB code into Java.

2. **Potentially reviving my audio signal decorrelation project**. I had developed a VST plugin last year but shelved it
   due to limited interest and no pre-sales. Now I'm reconsidering â€“ maybe I could sell it to AV companies, the
   automotive industry, or cinema sound professionals. Many suffer from comb filtering problems introduced by
   destructive interference, and this would be a powerful solution.

## Your Turn

I'm curious: Do you have any business ideas for me? What's one thing that bothered you this morning? What's been on your
to-do list for more than a week? What did you try to buy recently, only to discover it didn't exist?

Leave me a comment or shoot me an email. Your frustrations might be my next opportunity!
