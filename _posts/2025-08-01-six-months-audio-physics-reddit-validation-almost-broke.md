Greeting land dweller! ðŸ¦¦

It's been a while since my last update, and honestly, that's because I've been hiding in the weeds of audio signal
processing code. Fun times!

## Quick review of the last 6 months.

In January, I created an ambitious directory website plan. That got cancelled quickly when I showed it to a business
coach I respect, and he
said "the world doesn't need another directory." After a brief existential crisis, I pivoted back to what I actually
know: audio physics.

[GainGuardian](https://gainguardian.com/) became my obsession. Adam Hill and I partnered up to commercialize his Diffuse
Signal Processing researchâ€”technology that can solve comb filtering, room modes, and crossover alignment issues that
plague every sound system from car audio to concert halls.

I thought translating Adam's code from research into a commercial product would take maybe two weeks. I was literally
telling potential customers, "Hey, I'll have demo files for you in a week or two!"

That was six months ago.

Turns out, there's a massive difference between research code that proves a concept and production code that actually
works reliably in a number of use cases. Every time I thought I was close, another layer of complexity emerged. At this
moment the light at the end of the tunnel seems farther away than ever.

The good news? The technology is genuinely revolutionary. The bad news? This revolutionary technology isn't paying the
bills.

## The Cryptocurrency Time Capsule

Speaking of bills, let me tell you about my accidental savings account. Back in 2022, I was playing around with
cryptocurrency day trading platforms like Crypto Hopperâ€”basically gambling with a little extra money because it seemed
fun. I
quickly lost interest when I realized I wasn't making any money, and it was just stressing me out. I just put the little
I had left in a wallet in a DeFi investment platform and proceeded to forget about it.

Fast-forward to this summer when I'm staring at mounting bills and remembering this forgotten digital money. Initially,
I couldn't even access it due to some browser technical issues, but once I figured that out, it was like finding a
hundred-dollar bill in an old coat pocketâ€”except it was enough to pay down some debt.

Not life-changing money, but definitely a welcome surprise when you're wondering how to keep the lights on.

## Reddit Validation: When 107 Upvotes Don't Equal Customers

After months of pure technical work on GainGuardian, I had what I thought was a brilliant pivot idea: a "tiny CRM for
introverts." The concept came from my own struggle with staying in touch with past clients. I'd do great work for
someone, they'd love me, then six months later they'd book someone elseâ€”not because I wasn't good enough, but because
they forgot I existed.

I've tried traditional CRMs over the years, but they're all overwhelming for someone who just needs gentle reminders to
check in with people. So I envisioned something simple: daily reminders of who to follow up with, context about your
last interaction, and maybe even suggestions for what to say.

I posted the idea on Reddit, copying a validation strategy I'd seen on YouTube. The response seemed
amazing: [107 upvotes, 73 comments, 32k views](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1m7jfy2/anyone_else_lose_gigs_because_artistsmanagers/).
People were sharing their own struggles with relationship maintenance, discussing failed systems, and generally engaging
like crazy.

But here's the brutal lesson I keep learning: **people who complain about problems don't necessarily pay to solve them.
**

When I direct messaged several engaged commenters with a demo video, exactly zero watched it. When I sent the idea to my
entire Sound Design Live mailing list, zero people responded. Crickets. ðŸ¦—

Using [my own keyword research tool](https://www.b2bdemandgenerationstrategy.com/), I discovered that live sound
engineers aren't
searching for CRM solutions. But realtors, accountants, and lawyers are. So I briefly considered pivoting to serve those
markets, but after talking to one realtor friend, I realized they already have CRMs that work fine for them.

I still think it's a cool idea and would be a good product for myself, but I might be the only user.

## Freelance Life Calls

Here's the uncomfortable truth: it's been about five years since I've been this close to broke, and it doesn't feel
great for someone pushing 45 who's been teaching and coaching others for years. The privilege of not having kids or a
mortgage means I can take these risks, but it doesn't make the bank account look any less scary.

So I've had to step back from pure product development and think about immediate income. This meant two things:

1. **Saying yes to live sound shows again**â€”which I'm honestly nervous about since I haven't worked events in months and
   wasn't enjoying it much before I stopped
2. **Pursuing custom software freelance work**â€”positioning myself as
   a [custom automation expert](https://github.com/livenathan/) to help AV companies
   connect different parts of their business software

For the freelance strategy, I went back through my contacts from last year when I interviewed over 50 managers at
commercial AV integrators for a SaaS product I never built. I started emailing them one by one, pivoting from "I build
SaaS products" to "I build custom solutions."

After two days of full-time outreach, I was ready to quitâ€”it was sucking the life out of me. So I scaled back to a
process goal: email 2â€“3 people every morning, then move on with my day. Much more sustainable, and it's actually
generated some results.

I've had two meetings that resulted in proposal requests, and one company seems to have genuine urgency around their
needs. So while it's not the entrepreneurial dream, it feels good to be engaging with potential customers again.

## What's Next?

My current reality is a three-pronged approach:

1. **Daily freelance outreach**: 2â€“3 emails to AV industry contacts every morning
2. **Continued GainGuardian development**: Slow but steady progress with Adam
3. **Upcoming live sound shows**: September, October, and November gigs that I'm nervous about but grateful for

The interesting thing is how I can frame this situation. I could easily spiral into "woe is me, I'm failing at
everything." Or I can appreciate that I have diverse skills and experiences that let me pivot when things get tight. I'm
choosing the latter, even when it doesn't always feel natural.

I don't have grand plans for Augustâ€”just doing the work, focusing on process goals, and seeing what develops. Sometimes
that's enough.

Thanks for following along on this messy journey. If you've got any AV automation challenges or just want to commiserate
about the ups and downs of building something from scratch, hit replyâ€”I'd love to hear from you.

P.S. - If you're curious about the technical side of what we're building with GainGuardian, I'll be writing more about
convolution, signal processing, and the fascinating physics behind why every sound system has problems we can actually
solve. That's the fun stuff that keeps me going when the business side gets tough.
