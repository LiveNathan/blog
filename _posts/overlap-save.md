# Overlap Save Method for Frequency Domain Convolution: A Practical Approach

## Introduction

> While programming can help in understanding mathematical concepts, it's not the other way around. — Mike X. Cohen

Math is hard. And I think part of why it's so hard is the use of so many symbols. But I guess it's the same when
learning any language. At the beginning it all looks like jibberish. Eventually, with practice, you are no longer
sounding out each syllable, you just see patterns of works and sentences. I can do this with various amounts of ease
with English, Portuguese, Java, and MATLAB.

Euler's formula is considered to be one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics. It can be written like
this: $e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$

In MATLAB you can write it like this: `result = exp(1i * x) - (cos(x) + 1i * sin(x));`

But it's easier to read like this:

```matlab
angleInRadians = pi;
result = exp(1i * angleInRadians) + 1;
xCoordinate = real(result);
yCoordinate = imag(result);
```

Or in Java:

```java
double angleInRadians = Math.PI;
Complex result = Complex.ofPolar(1.0, angleInRadians).add(Complex.ONE);
double xCoordinate = result.getReal();
double yCoordinate = result.getImaginary();
```

As a developer working on audio processing, I recently found myself struggling to implement the overlap save method for
frequency domain convolution. Despite searching through numerous resources, I couldn't find an explanation that clicked
with my brain. Most materials were either too abstract or too heavily focused on mathematical concepts. I did find some
code examples but they, but none of them made sense to me.

This blog post is my attempt to explain the overlap save method in a way that would have helped me understand it faster.
I'll focus on practical implementations in MATLAB and Java, showing code examples rather than complex equations whenever
possible. By writing this, I'm hoping to solidify my own understanding while providing a resource for other developers
facing similar challenges.

**Disclaimer:** I don't have a formal background in DSP. I'm a sound engineer turned software developer learning DSP
concepts as
I implement them in real projects. If you spot technical errors or have suggestions for improvement, please share them
in the comments or send me a DM!

## Background

When processing audio signals, convolution is a fundamental operation that allows us to combine two signals. This is
often how we get reverb or simulate acoustic spaces but can also be used to apply EQ filters. There are two main
approaches to convolution: time domain and frequency
domain.

signal + kernel = result

### Time Domain vs. Frequency Domain Convolution

Time domain convolution combines two time series. At each signal sample you calculate the dot product of the kernel and
the signal to get the result, which is the new sample at that position. Then you go to the next signal sample. It's just
addition and multiplication. It's straightforward to
understand and implement, produces high-quality results, and is perfectly suitable for offline processing. However, it
becomes computationally expensive for long signals or large kernels, making it impractical for real-time applications.
Not only do you have to visit every sample in the signal, but then for each signal sample, you have to visit every
sample in the kernel giving you a loop inside of a loop, which is a complexity of O(N²).

Here's what it might look like in Java. Even if the code isn't clear to you, you can still see that's only addition and
multiplication.

```java
public class TimeConvolution {

   public static double[] convolve(double[] signal, double[] kernel) {
      int outputLength = signal.length + kernel.length - 1;
      double[] result = new double[outputLength];

      for (int outputIndex = 0; outputIndex < outputLength; outputIndex++) {
         for (int kernelIndex = 0; kernelIndex < kernel.length; kernelIndex++) {
            int signalIndex = outputIndex - kernelIndex;
            if (signalIndex >= 0 && signalIndex < signal.length) {
               result[outputIndex] += signal[signalIndex] * kernel[kernelIndex];
            }
         }
      }

      return result;
   }
}
```

For my project, Gain Guardian, we initially implemented time domain convolution for offline processing. In my case my
kernels are usually 8192 samples long so it takes about 30 seconds to perform convolution on a normal music file. While
this approach works well and produces high-quality results, it is simply too slow for real-time processing.

### The Convolution Theorem

The convolution theorem states that convolution in the time domain equals multiplication in the frequency domain:

```java
public class FrequencyConvolution {

   public static double[] convolve(double[] signal, double[] kernel) {
      int resultLength = signal.length + kernel.length - 1;

      Complex[] signalSpectrum = FFT.forward(signal, resultLength);
      Complex[] kernelSpectrum = FFT.forward(kernel, resultLength);

      Complex[] convolutionSpectrum = new Complex[resultLength];
      for (int i = 0; i < resultLength; i++) {
         convolutionSpectrum[i] = signalSpectrum[i].multiply(kernelSpectrum[i]);
      }

      Complex[] result = FFT.inverse(convolutionSpectrum);

      return extractReal(result, signal.length);
   }

   private static double[] extractReal(Complex[] complexResult, int outputLength) {
      double[] result = new double[outputLength];
      for (int i = 0; i < outputLength; i++) {
         result[i] = complexResult[i].real();
      }
      return result;
   }
}
```

In theory, time domain convolution and frequency domain convolution should produce identical results. However, in
practice, there are differences due to:

- Numerical precision issues
- Circular vs. linear convolution effects
- Implementation details

In my experience the two samples above should produce matching results to a precision of 1e-14, which is high!

### Why Real-time Applications Need Frequency Domain Approaches

For real-time applications, frequency domain convolution offers significant performance advantages. By transforming the
signal and kernel to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), performing multiplication, and then
transforming back using Inverse FFT (IFFT), we can reduce the computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).

The key to real-time processing is to work with blocks of the input signal rather than waiting for the entire signal.
The size of these blocks directly affects latency – smaller blocks reduce latency but increase computational overhead
due to more frequent FFT operations.

## 3. Overlap Methods Overview

### Why We Need Overlap Methods

When processing signals in blocks using frequency domain convolution, we encounter an important issue: the FFT
inherently performs circular convolution, while we typically want linear convolution for audio processing. This
discrepancy causes artifacts at the block boundaries.

To address this problem, we use overlap methods, which ensure correct results at block boundaries. The two primary
approaches are:

1. **Overlap Add**: Process each block independently with zero-padding, then add the overlapping output portions
2. **Overlap Save**: Process overlapping input blocks and discard portions affected by circular convolution

The overlap save method attracted my attention for two key reasons:

1. It's generally more computationally efficient because it doesn't require additional storage for accumulating results
2. It allows for implementing frequency domain crossfades between kernels, which is crucial for my application where
   filters need to change frequently

## 4. Basic Overlap Save Implementation

### Algorithm Explanation

The overlap save method works by:

1. Dividing the input signal into overlapping blocks
2. Applying FFT to each block
3. Multiplying with the FFT of the zero-padded kernel
4. Applying IFFT to get the time domain result
5. Discarding the first M-1 samples (where M is the kernel length) from each result block
6. Concatenating the valid parts of each result block

The key insight is that by processing overlapping segments and discarding the circular convolution artifacts, we can
achieve linear convolution results efficiently.

### MATLAB Implementation

Here's a basic implementation of the overlap save method in MATLAB:

```matlab
function y = overlapSave(x, h, blockSize)
    % x: input signal
    % h: impulse response (kernel)
    % blockSize: size of each processing block
    
    M = length(h);  % Kernel length
    L = blockSize;  % Block size
    N = L + M - 1;  % FFT size
    
    % Zero pad h to length N
    h_padded = [h; zeros(N - M, 1)];
    H = fft(h_padded);  % FFT of zero-padded kernel
    
    % Prepare for processing
    numBlocks = ceil((length(x) + M - 1) / L);
    x_padded = [zeros(M - 1, 1); x; zeros(numBlocks * L - length(x), 1)];
    y = zeros(length(x_padded) - (M - 1), 1);  % Output signal
    
    % Process each block
    for i = 1:numBlocks
        % Extract overlapping block
        blockStart = (i - 1) * L + 1;
        xBlock = x_padded(blockStart:(blockStart + N - 1));
        
        % Process in frequency domain
        X = fft(xBlock);
        Y = X .* H;
        yBlock = real(ifft(Y));
        
        % Keep only the valid part (discard first M-1 samples)
        validPart = yBlock(M:end);
        
        % Add to output
        outStart = (i - 1) * L + 1;
        y(outStart:(outStart + L - 1)) = validPart;
    end
    
    % Trim output to match expected output length
    y = y(1:(length(x) + M - 1));
end
```

### Testing Against Time Domain Convolution

To verify that our implementation is correct, we should compare it with MATLAB's built-in time domain convolution:

```matlab
% Test signal and kernel
x = randn(10000, 1);  % Random input signal
h = randn(512, 1);    % Random kernel (impulse response)
blockSize = 1024;     % Processing block size

% Time domain convolution (reference)
y_ref = conv(x, h);

% Overlap save implementation
y_os = overlapSave(x, h, blockSize);

% Compare results
error = max(abs(y_ref - y_os));
fprintf('Maximum error: %e\n', error);

% Plot comparison
figure;
subplot(3,1,1); plot(y_ref); title('Time Domain Convolution');
subplot(3,1,2); plot(y_os); title('Overlap Save Method');
subplot(3,1,3); plot(y_ref - y_os); title('Difference');
```

## 5. Advanced Challenges: Handling Long Kernels

When the kernel length exceeds the block size, the basic overlap save implementation breaks down. This is a common
challenge in applications like room acoustics or long reverb effects, where impulse responses can be thousands of
samples long.

### Kernel Partitioning Techniques

To handle long kernels efficiently, we need to partition the impulse response into smaller segments that can be
processed separately and then combined. There are several approaches to kernel partitioning:

1. **Uniform Partitioning**: The simplest approach divides the kernel into equal-length segments.
2. **Non-uniform Partitioning**: Uses variable-length segments to optimize performance.
3. **Gardner's Method**: A widely used technique that specifically optimizes for long kernels.

The uniform partitioning approach works as follows:

1. Divide the kernel into segments of length L (matching the block size)
2. Process each segment separately using the overlap save method
3. Sum the delayed outputs from each segment

Here's how to implement uniform partitioning in MATLAB:

```matlab
function y = overlapSavePartitioned(x, h, blockSize)
    % x: input signal
    % h: impulse response (kernel)
    % blockSize: size of each processing block
    
    L = blockSize;
    
    % Determine number of partitions
    numPartitions = ceil(length(h) / L);
    
    % Process each partition
    y = zeros(length(x) + length(h) - 1, 1);
    
    for p = 1:numPartitions
        % Extract partition
        startIdx = (p-1) * L + 1;
        endIdx = min(p * L, length(h));
        h_part = h(startIdx:endIdx);
        
        % Zero-pad if necessary
        if length(h_part) < L
            h_part = [h_part; zeros(L - length(h_part), 1)];
        end
        
        % Process using basic overlap save
        y_part = overlapSave(x, h_part, L);
        
        % Add to result with appropriate delay
        delay = (p-1) * L;
        y(delay+1:delay+length(y_part)) = y(delay+1:delay+length(y_part)) + y_part;
    end
    
    % Trim to expected length
    y = y(1:length(x) + length(h) - 1);
end
```

## 6. Crossfades Between Kernels

One of the most challenging aspects of real-time convolution is handling changes in the impulse response. For
applications like Gain Guardian that need to switch kernels frequently, smoothly transitioning between impulse responses
is crucial to avoid audible artifacts.

### Why Kernel Crossfades Are Needed

When an impulse response changes suddenly, it can cause audible clicks, pops, or other artifacts in the output signal.
This is especially problematic for applications where parameters are adjusted in real-time, such as:

- Variable acoustic spaces in games
- Dynamic equalization
- Adaptive filtering systems

### Frequency Domain Crossfades

The traditional approach to kernel crossfades involves:

1. Running two parallel convolution processes with different kernels
2. Crossfading their outputs in the time domain

However, this doubles the computational cost. A more efficient approach is to perform the crossfade directly in the
frequency domain.

The frequency domain crossfade technique works as follows:

1. Calculate the FFT of both the current and target kernels
2. Perform a weighted sum of these frequency representations
3. Use the resulting combined frequency representation for convolution

Here's a basic implementation:

```matlab
function y = overlapSaveCrossfade(x, h1, h2, blockSize, crossfadeBlocks)
    % x: input signal
    % h1: initial impulse response
    % h2: target impulse response
    % blockSize: size of each processing block
    % crossfadeBlocks: number of blocks over which to crossfade
    
    M = max(length(h1), length(h2));  % Kernel length
    L = blockSize;                    % Block size
    N = L + M - 1;                    % FFT size
    
    % Zero pad kernels to length N
    h1_padded = [h1; zeros(N - length(h1), 1)];
    h2_padded = [h2; zeros(N - length(h2), 1)];
    
    % FFT of zero-padded kernels
    H1 = fft(h1_padded);
    H2 = fft(h2_padded);
    
    % Prepare for processing
    numBlocks = ceil((length(x) + M - 1) / L);
    x_padded = [zeros(M - 1, 1); x; zeros(numBlocks * L - length(x), 1)];
    y = zeros(length(x_padded) - (M - 1), 1);  % Output signal
    
    % Process each block
    for i = 1:numBlocks
        % Calculate crossfade weight
        if i <= crossfadeBlocks
            alpha = (i - 1) / crossfadeBlocks;  % Linear crossfade
        else
            alpha = 1;
        end
        
        % Create interpolated kernel in frequency domain
        H = (1 - alpha) * H1 + alpha * H2;
        
        % Extract overlapping block
        blockStart = (i - 1) * L + 1;
        xBlock = x_padded(blockStart:(blockStart + N - 1));
        
        % Process in frequency domain
        X = fft(xBlock);
        Y = X .* H;
        yBlock = real(ifft(Y));
        
        % Keep only the valid part (discard first M-1 samples)
        validPart = yBlock(M:end);
        
        % Add to output
        outStart = (i - 1) * L + 1;
        y(outStart:(outStart + L - 1)) = validPart;
    end
    
    % Trim output to match expected output length
    y = y(1:(length(x) + M - 1));
end
```

This approach offers approximately 30% better performance compared to running two separate convolutions and crossfading
in the time domain. It also provides a more elegant solution since everything remains in the frequency domain.
