</div><p>Greetings! ðŸ¦–</p><p>(never mind, just checked with my wife, turns out yellowâ€™s ok again)</p><p>Welcome! ðŸ¦¦</p><p>
    A quick note on how these posts are written: I typically do a stream-of-consciousness brain dump (usually via
    dictation), then work with Claude (Anthropic's AI) to organize and structure the content before my final edits. It
    makes writing more enjoyable for me and hopefully creates a better reading experience for you. I'm mentioning this
    upfront since I know AI assistance can be controversial for some readers.</p><p>Why start another blog? A few
    reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Personal journal and accountability for my next business venture</p></li>
    <li><p>Public documentation to help clarify my own thoughts</p></li>
    <li><p>Maybe it helps someone else on a similar journey</p></li>
    <li><p>Support and feedback from others building in public</p></li>
</ol><p>Why Substack? Honestly, laziness. I couldn't decide on the tech stack for nathanlively.com's blog, and Sound
    Design Live hasn't felt like the right place while exploring beyond audio. These posts will focus on business but
    include insights about software development (Java, Vaadin, Spring, TDD, Hexagonal Architecture) and life (hot
    chocolate, ACIM, movies).</p><h2>Building a Profitable Micro-SaaS Through Directory-First Validation</h2><p>After
    years of building products in the live sound space, I'm embarking on a focused 5-month journey to establish a
    profitable micro-SaaS business. This post outlines my strategy, learnings from past ventures, and concrete plan for
    the months ahead.</p><h3>The Plan</h3><p>I'm dedicating the next 5 months (through July 1, 2025) to rapidly
    launching and testing multiple directory websites while developing a keyword research tool. The goal: identify real
    market demand through observed behavior rather than just customer interviews.</p><h3>Core Strategy</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Launch 5 directories in rapid succession (targeting 3-5 weeks total)</p></li>
    <li><p>Use real traffic and engagement data to validate opportunities</p></li>
    <li><p>Develop products based on observed user behavior and needs</p></li>
    <li><p>Focus on B2B problems with clear ROI potential</p></li>
</ol><h3>Why Directories?</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Launch fast!</strong> Directories are one of the fastest things to launch that can deliver real value
        and get feedback. Ever since I read The 7 Day Startup years ago Iâ€™ve dreamed of actually finding something I
        could launch quickly like this. Hopefully this is the answer.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Abandon my clever ideas.</strong> Iâ€™ve spent years working on projects that I thought were important
        or special or revolutionary. No one cared. Personal demand â‰  market demand. I need a process that focuses on
        discovering real market demand.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Free tools consistently gain organic traction.</strong> Tracebook: 2000+ users without marketing. AV
        Technician Hire: Consistent traffic post-launch. Sound Design Live YT channel: Over 1M downloads and growing.
        Pattern: Free tools provide natural path to discover customer problems</p></li>
</ol><h3>Success Metrics</h3><p>Base Target: $3,000 MRR by July 1, 2025 through either:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>30+ customers at $100/month OR</p></li>
    <li><p>12+ customers at $250/month</p></li>
</ul><p>Stretch Goal: Push toward $30,000 MRR with more aggressive acquisition</p><p>Why? See The 10X Rule.</p><h3>
    Learning From Past Ventures</h3><p>Key insights that shaped this strategy:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Customer interviews alone don't indicate buying intent</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><p>6 months of AV_Sync development.</p></li>
    <li><p>50+ professional interviews.</p></li>
    <li><p>Result: 0 customers despite positive feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
    <li><p>Quit sooner</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><p>SubAligner: 4+ years. Never could break $1k MRR.</p></li>
    <li><p>Sound Design Live: The last two years of offers had less and less interest.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
    <li><p>Avoid requiring behavior change</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><p>Phase Invaders: Failed despite pre-sales. Live sound engineers donâ€™t want to practice at home.</p></li>
    <li><p>Ready Set Pro: Production AV runs on personal referral. Donâ€™t fight it.</p></li>
</ul><h3>Follow Along</h3><p>I'll be documenting progress weekly as I:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Build and launch directories and apps</p></li>
    <li><p>Analyze traffic patterns</p></li>
    <li><p>Identify product opportunities</p></li>
    <li><p>Develop solutions for validated problems</p></li>
</ol><p>This is my first venture outside the live sound space - looking forward to learning and sharing along the
    way.</p>
