n all right hello folks uh what is going empty hey VES oh there we are uh what is going seems my camera is stuck nope
nope it's on my end actually it's on streamyards ah it's always tough getting back into it uh so not sure why streamyard
is having issues let's go check all right I'm gonna have to well I don't know what's going on um everything is fine on
my end but streamyard is not happy at all uh no I have not paid my streamyard bill but I'm November uh and when I we'll
be canceling it because this is not the first time I've had issues plus they doubled their rates um boy this really it
is saying my connection is not this e all right um so I switched to Chrome that seems to be working better uh I don't
know what's wrong wrong with the other everyone um that's what happens when you uh it's like trying to run uh go out for
a run when you haven't run in a while everything is like oh that hurts that's not working right what's going on this is
terrible um so hey everyone now now now you can actually see me matching uh and and my voice will match what what you
see on on the camera you um lexers knees hurt at the thought yeah I had trained for a half marathon uh and unfortunately
the half marathon was taking place at the height of the hot weather here in the Bay Area when it would basically hit a
100 and it's like it's not like running a half marathon is enjoyable throughout um but I do I do like running I just
don't like running in in like 80 90 degree weather uh that is not not good not fun um that's just miserable miserable uh
yes facial hair um so hey folks uh so it has been a while uh um my the stream today is basically mostly like just
getting stuff to work getting getting uh um getting stuff back back back in order getting used to streaming again um so
they're so today's mostly like almost chat-like stuff um I realized I don't have my which window open that's that's not
good hold on and so all the all the things that like you know you have smooth when you've been doing something for a
while it's it's all over the place it's like where the heck is that button what is that thing um and so yeah so it's
more of a bit of a hangout um there is one thing that I'm that I need to do uh which is Java one is coming back um so if
you're not familiar with the Java 1 conference that was one of the uh big conferences back in the late 90s early 2000s
um slowly trailed off in in like the the the 201s uh and then was combined with like the Oracle stuff in Las Vegas uh
but in 2025 um it is coming back to the San Francisco Bay area in fact um it's coming back to Redwood Shores which is
literally uh where I run past every day when when I go running so it's like two miles away from me so that'll that'll be
really nice and very convenient uh call for papers is is is open and closes in like three hours so um as is usual uh I'm
gonna submit it on the last day um so that's one thing I'll be doing um there's some other stuff that that uh I'm
working on uh some sample code for um for a course uh that I'm working on uh there's also a problem with the plugin so
I've been sort of maintaining maintaining I've been trying trying to keep the presentation assistant Fork uh compatible
with recent releases the latest EAP for the next release of intellig it's one of those oh our API changed right because
every single freaking release of intellig the API changes uh for for plugins and so um previously I've just been able to
upgrade the the uh the version of intellig that that plugin's compatible with and it's like oh it works but now I have
to do a little bit more work and and figure out what class is no longer found in the API and what do I replace it with
so uh so those so it's sort of a miscellaneous day um next week uh I'll be getting back to uh in between Mets games so
in case you have not been following uh in case you don't care about baseball or in case you haven't you were not aware
that I'm a baseball fan specifically a New York Mets fan let's go Mets um where's my Mets Hat oh I'll find it uh the
Mets made made the next round of playoffs um so they're playing next week uh sometimes in the afternoon which would
conflict with the times that I stream but actually it looks like a lot of the games uh on Wednesday and Thursday will be
in the evening so they won't my time so won't interfere with streaming uh so next week I will be streaming back to
putting my tddd game uh online um no I don't remember where I left off well I do kind of remember but like it's been a
while so it'll take a little while to to get back into things uh and also I will be pair streaming with Mike um
depending on his his availability in terms of papers for Java 1 uh so I've got a few talks um one of them related to to
the tddd game which is basically event sourcing using modern Java uh since it is the Java one conference um it's
obviously very Java focused uh which means that um which is great because that's that's what I do uh but I also want it
to be sort of specific to Java things that are that have been introduced in a language or or coming up in a language um
so uh one one is on aarch a so as you may know I've given talks on a search a and so pretty much be uh very similar talk
to to what I've done before um so that's one paper uh what was the next one so the other one is event sourcing with
modern Java and um and uh talk on Arc unit so enforcing architecture with with Arc unit uh so I think those are the
three papers that I'm probably to submit yes so stuff like sealed classes and records and interfaces and and uh switch
Expressions that take advantage of sealed classes uh things things like that hey tkes nice to see you yes great to be
back uh so I was I was looking at uh so let me see if I can bring this up so let's see can I share my screen is that all
right uh so let's do that and that okay he nice to see you all all the folks are back uh all right so let's click the
right button to present uh let's share the full screen um all right I'm using a different browser Chrome chrome chrome
chrome you have access why do you not see that access I am dreading upgrading to the most recent version of Mac OS
because all the security questions that come up it's like hey this is asking for access to this and to this and to this
and to this and especially the screen recording stuff apparently it's going to ask you frequently to say are you sure
you still want to be sharing this and so I am dreading that because a lot of the apps I use are uh are like video
recording things all right let's see is this going to let me screen share was cancelled no it's not going to let me do
it Chrome uh let's see m v visty yes absolutely it very much that's that's um yeah I I really question some of that
stuff uh all right I will I gotta see if I can restart Chrome and see if it can start recognizing the screen because it
should have access um so let's see what happens I'll be right back yes I'm supposed to be just chatting uh uh I can't
chat if I can't share the screen well not exactly all right hold on let's try this hopefully I'll be back shortly all
right camera's still working let's see if the present works computers suck software sucks that's all I got to say let's
all complain about sucks um let's see uh all right let's do this let me open all right that's banned it is still it is
amazing I mean it is amazingly profitable for software to be saddest It's just sad okay uh oh what oh okay I'm like now
it shows the screen so uh what's interesting is the browser so streamyard because it's running in the browser can share
things that the browser owns so it has that much P per permission but it can't share anything else but that's fine I
opened window and an to Stage hey uh which do I like better no no this is not a news report yeah I don't know I I I you
see things like crowd the crowd strike disaster and you see other things and you just maybe some fines are paid uh even
though it was hugely disruptive I don't I don't know that the government is willing to to do anything about um Java one
is back so uh the I have to say like I've submitted to probably six or seven conferences this past year and didn't get
into any um but I have to say like the these submission they say submission tips but this these aren't tips these are
like requirements this is what they're asking for uh it's a bit much like I get it um it's a little it's a little much
like uh use present tense okay fine um do not use first person odd because it makes the language much more formal than I
think it needs to be um anyway there it was I was reading these and it's like this is a bit uh this is a a bit bit of a
lot but you know basically it's it's Oracle um and I've submitted stuff to uh it felt very this feels very much big
Corporation kind of thing because when I submitted to VMware spring the spring part of V the VMware conference um it
definitely had this like we're we're a big Corporation and we need to add in lots of lots of rules um I did get accepted
to that except then they changed it from an in-person thing to a semi virtual thing and I was like forget this easy yeah
uh I mean it's the site is is is more nicely late like there's a certain feel to to the uh to the call paper submission
that I did for the for the spring the spring VMware conference where it very much felt like this was designed in typical
enterprise software fashion um this at least seems to be a bit easier uh so there are six tracks um so in terms of a
present tense and passive uh I'm gonna have to see how how how how this works out um so the core Java go because it's
certainly not UI client and front end oh that was the other one okay I'm glad I was looking looking through these uh HTM
X and uh and and spring boot that bit hopefully it won't be too considered to Spring boot Centric because it's really
about the HTM X um but that would definitely go in front right uh Dr twishy asks about what is my paper on event
sourcing um uh you didn't miss much I basically said event sourcing um using leveraging the uh modern Java features like
sealed classes switch uh pattern matching switch Expressions record deconstruction uh things like that uh all right so
let's see so tracks uh for Java that's going to be probably the event sourcing PL uh in modern Java hey cattle nice to
see you yes dude I mean this is my kydc on hi there I'm the signature for days okay yep right thanks get not sure what
what this is oh right so weird I ordered replacement um replacement uh uh for these headphones these headphones are like
I don't know 15 years old um so I got Replacements and signatures required it's like they're anyway uh what was I doing
oh yeah okay so event sourcing in modern Java um so all right hold on now one thing I didn't see sessions because this
is what happened with the with the spring VMware conference is I submitted my talk um and then they did two things they
changed the format to be this semi virtual inperson thing and then they then they reduce the talk time like the 30
minutes that's not that's a that's a different kind of talk than an hour kind of talk um yeah I mean my guess would be
an hour because that's fairly typical but don't I wonder if that's somewhere in the um actual submission so let's go
into to this apparently this will time out in in a certain amount of time but let's take a look uh content type ah here
we go wow 45 minutes for a breakout session I don't I don't know how I feel about that of I mean it is what it is so I
was at the devt next conference uh which is sometimes called some Sometimes some people were calling the ven cut
conference because if you know ven cut superm monium um I mean he's like everywhere uh you look at any conference that
has Java related stuff in it and he's there um so this was his conference in in uh outside of Denver Colorado um and
those talks were anywhere from an hour to an hour and 15 minutes I think actually an hour and 15 minutes is uh a nice
amount of time if you have a very dense topic there were some where it's like that they went short because they couldn't
minutes oh that's interesting you can't see I wonder if because it's that's that drop down is considered a separate
window uh so let me stop sharing and let me screen still may not work because it may still from a security standpoint
still may be considered a separate window let's see what happens well I wonder if this is a chrome would one I'm very
confused somewhere somebody doesn't have preferences oh now it's still back to the work yeah I'm using streamyard but it
seems to it was having problems in Brave which had all the permissions which is what um yeah I know that uh intell J
definitely the pop-ups are separate windows and I guess in Chrome they are as well that's interesting all right screen
okay well anyway there's a popup here and it shows two things Hands-On lab for 105 minutes uh and breakout um I'm glad
I'm glad you trust me uh so saying right so um so last week at the conference um like an hour and 15 minutes is long is
is a bit long I mean I could certainly bill it I've done that but uh anyway that's that's that's what that yeah I agree
I agree V it's like the browser owns the popup so if I have permission to show the browser why would I not have the
permission to show the popup very strange it's not like this is um if it custom like complete from scratch that would
probably work but they're using I guess the built-in drop down so uh all right okay so um so you can't see that either
uh so I've got I've got another window open where I'm taking notes but you can't see it which sucks but it is what it is
um so uh for the core Java track the event sourcing is that going to be 45 minutes so 105 minutes that's an hour and
Workshop I mean I could maybe figure something out but I minutes well I'll figure I'll figure out how to how to squeeze
it into 45 minutes if I get it if I get it accepted uh so the question is is of it's one of those talks where I'm where
you know am I using modern language modern Java language stuff and that's the focus uh and event sourcing happens to be
a good application or is event sourcing the focus and I just happen to be using some Java language uh feature that make
it easier um not sure but uh let's do this uh can I split work uh no that won't work that's interesting oh because I'm
sharing the window yeah yes it is Oracle and it is Java one um so I think the focus will be mostly features yeah uh all
right so um this will be the 45 be where do I store the data so the interesting the the cool thing about event sourcing
is like how and where you events I mean typically you'll store it do I want to use spring oracles Cloud no um I could
store it an Oracle database um but really it's like do I use I mean since the data is basically Json for events because
it's pretty much like it's not that it's unstructured data it's just that each event has different a different structure
um I could just store it in a text file or I could store it using just jdbc Apache Derby uh spring does not have
explicit support for event sourcing um I mean it's sort of a agnostic it provides you know data access and so on it
would be interesting to create uh some kind of something that would make it easier to do like there is a full full-blown
framework like axon and I think it's just Overkill um but it because among many things it provides it sourcing project
lome uh bell oh uh build on problematic um would not surprise me if it has some oh well I guess it's end of life yeah so
light Bend basically change their their licensing uh yeah there is a fork of of um but I'm guessing uh you probably
don't want lome or like I assume it's yeah I'm not sure if it Dr tesy if it would be a layer on top of uh it would be
sort of a long side because um you don't you don't you like need nothing that jpa gives you this is this has been my my
my bug of bear um my big uh pet peeve is everybody using jpa when they a don't actually know what is doing underneath
because if they did they would be like oh my God I don't need all that complexity and overhead and they should really
just use spring data jdbc um but uh event sourcing needs actually so much less because you're not modifying you never
modify data that's already in the database so you you don't you still have to worry way yeah the the i i as much as I
like the idea the the actor platform stuff the virtual threads um so one of the talks one of the best talks of the
conference last week was Jose parmod who from Oracle who did a talk on uh is reactive dead um the short answer being yes
because you just use Virtual threads and then you just do your normal stuff and then when it blocks then some other
thread will will be running so um I think a lot of the I think reactive for sure is like you would never if you're
starting now you would not use reactive because what would be the point uh certainly if you've got Legacy stuff you
probably to move away from it but um if you're starting and you can start with Java 21 um why would you use stuff um all
right so that's that I don't like else um what's so what's the other okay yeah don't share don't share mutable State
avoid avoid contention for for mutable State yeah um so HDMX so that's going to go in oops use because I gotta use a
framework I mean I don't have to use the framework I could certainly use um just I mean I could use Jersey use I guess I
could use the Java I don't want to write my own server um it would have to be it it would be best if it was spring or
some other some other framework spring uh and that'll also be a four or breakout I mean the idea is to focus on um so
that uh dresy green thread stuff is it basically yes I mean it's kind of funny uh because I was around when green
threads were the thing um and so yes it basically is uh decoupling the thread object really uh from the operating system
thread because realistically you can't get more than like three or 4 thousand operating system threads um and so then
they be if and so up until Java 21 they are then a scarce resource which is why you have all sorts of thread pooling uh
mechanisms and so it's like okay you get to run on this thread for a bit uh you're blocked oh well that thread is now
not doing anything useful um and so you have to figure out other ways to to to keep that valuable thread uh actually run
actually making progress um virtual threads means you don't have to worry about that anymore the Java will will figure
out how to threads and um it is just it is then just as optimal is if you manually did uh reactive continuations and
things like exactly um I I don't know Lux if he's uh if he's given that talk and it's been recorded I'm not I'm not sure
I'll have to I'll have to take a look um remind me ask me in the Discord uh and I'll I'll I'll see see what I can find
um but the the short answer is reactive is dead why because reactive is such an awkward programming model um whereas if
you can just say well if I block Java will take care of it and then anymore hey bdsl uh does doing HTML x mean you have
a choice between typescript and JavaScript um I would say the idea of is you don't need even JavaScript at all um but if
you want to write some JavaScript that's totally fine uh they're not incompatible once you get to typescript then you
start having uh which is still fine uh because you end up with basically JavaScript um so it's um it it it really
depends on the complexity and and what you're what you're trying to do with the additional code that that's going to be
running in so it's you know it's it's a Continuum how much do you want um like again it's like what what what code would
be you you want to write in the browser that's really the question um if it's doing a lot of work that the back end
might be better to do I mean that's sort of the HTM X rest kind of thing is that the back end is the is a place for
State uh but again it it's you know depends on the kind of app writing uh let's see red PS tread pools yeah I mean so
one of one of the main ideas with with something like HTM X and HTM X is not the only Library there's also um I it's
Darkstar there's a couple of others uh but they're all in the same idea of like let's just add attributes to elements uh
in our HTML um and let let the JavaScript you know let the HDMX Library do stuff that you might manually write my
JavaScript for uh to me I think about it as why are we returning Json from apis if the browser is going to then take
that Json and convert it into HTML why don't I just return HTML um so that's that's to me the the thing he says they
should ban JavaScript that's going to be hard since that's what the browsers run on I mean I guess you could go to web
assembly but thing so Dr tesy the the green threads green threads were around I think they disappeared well before 1.2
I'd have to look it up but I'm 1.1 I believe they were gone um and uh they had to write that they had to originally
start with not associating Java threads with operating system threats because the operating systems right 90 1995 uh
there weren't a lot of them they couldn't support I don't remember what the upper limit was but it certainly was not
what modern processors and operating systems can support so there definitely was green threads um which essentially we
have returned full circle back too uh but much more powerful um but they I definitely by 1.2 they are gone I have a
feeling they were gone even before up uh let's see oh I was gonna open up go there it is I was looking for my twitch
stream manager which seems to um oh I guess I could do this uh yeah so time leaf or some HTML template engine is going
to be your friend um and if you've been watching if you had watched uh my online tdd game stuff which of course as I
said I'll I'll be picking up again next week um I am using HTM x uh the HTML generation though um I'm actually doing for
the most part manually I have not fully decided how much I want to do with time Leaf versus just manually generating
HTML in code there's a certain Tipping Point where it's like this this piece of HTML is getting too complex um to sort
of do in in plain old Java code uh especially since we don't yet have string interpolation uh I don't know when that's
going to come back um but it's gone for now so uh either a Time Leaf um jte is popular in some for some folks I don't
care for it one of the nice things I like about time Leaf is it's it's a natural template language in other words it's
basically HTML uh just with some decorations so you can preview it much more easily but um so I haven't figured out
figured that out yes so HDMX and that kind of thing are definitely meant for human consumption if the consumer of your
endpoint is another system another machine uh you're going to want it to be optimized for whatever that is um you could
use Json but because it is a it is easy to to sort of bug uh but it's very inefficient um but it's you know it's easy uh
if if it's actually RPC and because it's not really rest um most of the time systems calling systems are are RPC not
restful uh then you might look at like a grpc kind of thing or you're throwing stuff Kafka kind of thing uh and then it'
s still being consumed by by system yes if we're going to ban JavaScript yeah C so certainly if it's if it's going to be
converted to HTML HTML I would I would and certainly it seems like that's that's getting more um getting more inroads
into places that might have otherwise used a react or an that yeah I mean there's certainly folks who were like react is
always the answer um I'm not that person uh I think it's it has its place um but it's one of those technologies that
have become popular just because it's popular uh as opposed to it being the right solution for the problems that people
have if you were doing a system that has a lot of state that needs to be tracked in your browser very interactive very
deep UI um then react is is is likely appropriate uh but if it's pretty much forms and you're looking at stuff and then
pushing a button to see new stuff and change stuff then you're going to be hitting the back end and so instead of trying
to sync up the front end station with a backend State just let the back end hold on to client yeah tdd so as much as I
would like to do um a session on tdd uh and I need to stop chatting so I can actually get these in um uh I'm not sure
where it would fit uh this is my problem um I want to talk at conferences about tdd and um all the things around that
which is like refactoring um nobody cares conferences don't care most conferences could care less um and I'm basing that
on the fact that these talks that I'm submitting are not getting accepted that's the only yes uh uh so um yeah Dan Vega
has a has a good that it's not that time Leaf doesn't do enough um so the advantage of jte uh which is a Java template
engine is that it's faster in generating the HTML I don't know how how useful that is um it's a bit more type safe um
because it's not just doing sort of string search and replace there's actually some some compilable aspects um but
honestly I have not looked I have not used jte uh there's nothing wrong with with time Leaf there's just overhead um and
as with with any of these template engines there's a separation between the code that's that's generating things and
template yeah I don't know uh I don't know how popular HTM X is with rails it's very popular with Django um and um but
I'm I'm not sure how popular it is in with with rails because rails sort of already has its own way of doing things that
I'm not sure I don't I'm not yeah I'm not sure until I play with jte I'm not I'm not really sure of the the I am I am
very much anti- complexity I am very much boring stuff boring Technologies boring straightforward no microservices until
you actually need it modular stuff for easy about yeah I'm not sure how that would work for for something like GitHub I
mean GitHub will render the time LEF templates because they're just HTML but I'm not sure how two yeah Java and
postgress are always the answer what database do you need postgress but I'm doing postgress but I also need postgress
but what about yet and postgress postgress is always the answer there's there is no need for any uh catching up on chat
um so Eclipse has always had the ability for it to it basically used its own internal compiler um and so it could
partially compile things and partially run things even though the whole project wasn't compilable uh but in 2024 I don't
know why you um so as an example the conference I was at last week uh there was no talk on refactoring not that I saw
there also was no talk on explicitly on tdd again that I saw um and explicitly my submissions were rejected because they
were not quote on um so I I I understand like conferences are interesting in that they why go to a conference what do
you want to see and so it's often um the latest and greatest things whether they're suitable or not uh conferences like
qon are notorious for here's what million multi tens and hundreds of millions of customers here's what we do internally
so the Netflix's and the Ubers and the airbnbs here's what we're doing internally that by the way you should really not
be doing because you don't have our scale um but people love those talks because people love complexity that's that's
the only conclusion I can make um and whereas I preach anti- complexity and so I don't accepted yes rails is definitely
wait what no not Embrace yeah I mean tdd it certainly on the on the social medias it's controversial um because there
are people who are just like no it's stupid you shouldn't do it it's wrong it wastes time um whatever and I'm sure there
circumstances where that's true um and if that were just limited to tdd either all right I'm caught up on on I gotta I I
gotta submit the talks that I don't have to think a lot about so let me get those in um because the last thing I want to
do is is not have anything submitted because I definitely won't have any talks accepted uh so let um it's not talk my so
let's see my assert J practic on writing entity classes no my the best practice on running entity uh I I don't know like
just use events them uh okay so let's see what we need right so which track uh this this is my search a talk um just
thinking do I want to try and workshop think I think I'll go with a breakout yeah so I think it it certainly fits this
right because this mentions where is it uh testing um it's very much related to continuous integration tools and it
enhances Java applications yeah so certainly enhance enhancing I one okay uh so where did I put my right all right so
let's go and submit name content type breakout session uh title I am terrible with I'm open to better titles but that's
what I've got abstract let's see um I don't have so what do I what are those submission notes uh so tense uh so I'm
allowed to to use third person right yeah I think that's a bit too cheeky not that kind of relationship uh complicated
uh yeah except it's not one little trick it's like 25 little tricks I I mean I I can see that not using first person
helps you write an abstract that is sort of thinking about other people um like if I read an abstract and there's a lot
very a little bit unfriendly maybe I don't know yeah I don't I think this is gonna so my my hope is that this is GNA be
different from previous years um so I was talking to uh one one of the folks from Oracle sherat uh sh um at the devt I'm
if and this is sort of the problem with with procrastinating weight until the last minute is is uh had I done this last
week um I could have gotten some feedback from Char although he's been busy but all I can do is my desk right this one
thing I've learned about filling up forms like this is write it somewhere else and then copy paste because it said it
was going to time out and I'm not sure if I've already exceeded the timeout um and look I'm over out and I'll take that
out how about that easy J unit testing we um thanks for that pdsl uh all right I could do that that's a little bit of a
call I mean I love that this is allowing uh a thousand characters but only shows three lines so it's like and they must
have overridden something because usually you're allowed to to to drag the corner and expand a text area um they must
have why do I really like a search J as opposed to what so most folks if you're not using a search J you're likely just
using the built-in uh readable tests tests that are easy to yeah so that's the that's the back to um and I think that's
where the the um because they're what people mainly see when they're trying to pick out things and those are the the I
mean they're the I mean I could say maintainable testing that I don't know it's a I'm fine with adding it here which is
which is good title I could say made easier but it's I agree that easy is is is like what does that and that's why I
sort of started out with uh have aspect yeah I think assert true is is definitely harder to maintain and not as so I
guess it's do I use easier or do I talk read no it's talking about that they're they reserve the right to edit whatever
you do and so whatever they have put through their editing process that will be published in the in the conference all
right yes you you get um one you you I will distribute 100% of uh any any profit I don't believe they give you any money
for um but it's definitely a I don't know sure know uh I just know what I hit submit it's gonna say I've timed out but
we we'll see um so what I say the primary track was uh order this these are so you can't see the popup but they're in a
different order from from what's on the on the other page uh and secondary track what would a track yeah there is no
secondary track I didn't think I'd have to have an yeah it's not even an alphabetical order the the pop up here um
whatever uh have I done this talk and recorded does this requireed to be on well to show you how thoroughly unprepared I
am um I don't think I have a video recording of this talk that is uploaded did uh I do have the raw video when I did
webinar boy this is going to be an issue for all these talks I don't think I'll um I don't know that I gave the assert J
talk to any online Meetup um I did as a webinar a little over now yes I did this a case at at this recorded um now again
this is what happened when you do things at the last minute if if I had done this last week I could have uh video um
yeah I mean I don't have to but obviously it would improve my chances uh yeah if I had more time I'd make a video I i'
have less than two hours to get this in because the cfp closes at at five my I think this is one of those if I have time
uh I'll do that um but my concern is uh I still got other papers I want to I submit um but I I will totally do that if I
have time uh not a dumb question some people like to to just share knowledge and some people want to uh make themselves
um more known uh for whatever reason that might be um I fall into both categories I like sharing stuff but I also would
like to be known so that I can get consulting or training you certainly will not make money in general unless you're a
well-known speaker uh you will not make speaking there's also everybody gets free food at the conference uh you at least
get I mean depending on the conference you will get um it's not true for all conferences but 90 95 out of 100 you will
get free entrance to the conference so there's that um and so if you're in the conference the conferences have free food
uh often they have a speaker dinner so there's an extra meal that you will get um very uh so few will pay for travel and
even fewer will pay some kind of honorarium on top of that uh the conferences I've spoken at um like kcdc covered a
couple of nights of hotel but did not cover travel um or any other expenses uh another conference um gave an honorarium
which did not come close to covering travel expenses uh devton X which I did not get accepted to um is one of the few
that covered covered everything which um and then there there are Developer relations folks and so it's their job to
speak at conferences um that's a job I have after there's some depends on the conference but if if you're speaking at
conference you're in the conference and so you get to to join in on all the good stuff uh yes the conference is the
party depending uh depending on the conference um for all right um that's a really good question I I I think what it
does I mean you know what is bdd right um if it's making it such that um non-developers Can are are more likely to be
able to read it then absolutely uh this is this gives you that um especially when you have the the ability to customize
um the assertions to use more yeah I mean it's like what it to me bdd is always um the way I think about it is it's
where you start from the outside right whatever the edge of your system is um that sort of you know when you talk to
business people they think about what is a system how do I interact with it um tdd then it's basically to me then tdd
level uh I mean it doesn't require Advanced knowledge but I think it requires um it's certainly a more advanced feature
uh but I don't think it's intermediate and that it requires you to understand more deeply about like Java or something
like that I don't know the whole the whole levels thing is is like it's like it depends on like it's the whole like in a
job listing an experience level it's like you must have three plus years or five plus years like what does that mean
like you might have three years and and have really good experience and you might have five years been doing the out I I
mean it's it's it's basically what I expect um someone who's familiar with Java who's who's done who has some experience
uh what I expect them to be able to read and understand even the customized I guess that's it for here let's see if this
hey did it time out what happened did I it must have timed out is the only thing out yep um boy they can't even do the
timeout properly all right yes we saved that uh breakout session that good enough beginner back end framework open
source quality and testing I'm not going to check Enterprise architect that was actually just me joking uh yeah because
they're saving a session somewhere and that session object times out that's why big uh well I am an Enterprise architect
but the people in the audience do not need to be an an Enterprise architect like there all these things where it's like
I'm afraid of putting an aand and it's not going to get rejected uh Twitter handle is G Ted uh San Francisco jug um not
uh this is very this makes me very sad because if you look at all these conferences only like maybe three of them are in
the US um what was other uh AC DC um I'm blanking on the other conferences at it's been a while um I missed something uh
oh name yeah that's why I would they don't they don't write anything uh all right let me grab my well I I I guess uh
since he's the chairperson hopefully that bit yes but not conferences um I've done a bunch of meetups uh online but not
did I do any online conferences I don't think so I got accepted to a bunch before covid um but then nobody wants me know
Ted Young talk you might find uh there's a ruby person Ted Young uh I think works for light light step T yeah I agree
that's what they're asking um I'm going to take a quick break break get something to drink and then we'll look at the
next talk uh I don't remember what the what the next one I want to work on is probably the event sourcing one all right
so I'll all right every time I watch that video I was like oh I want to go make some coffee but it's too late in the
Talks I have no idea it's all um stock night all right uh so next talk um I think the event sourcing one is next
consider like my refactoring talk or my just so I think the event sourcing is uh is go oops all right I i' I've stopped
second guessing conference don't the feedback I get every time I submit those talks is not appropriate for this
conference to narrow to like I um if I have time I'll maybe I'll submit it as as a workshop I'm just uh pessimistic that
it all right so here um what we need is an need our La not that long ago it was 100° which is of course very hot for the
well for anywhere but certainly for the cold it's either that or we're sorry this talk not complex enough right it goes
back to that there's not enough complexity in um okay so this is interesting so I'm just rereading this this says
introductory uh that's not what the the radio button says so this says designed for audiences that have little or no
familiarity with this specific topic so does that mean theer is intermediate because it they have moderate familiarity I
don't know I still think it's introductory um and I'm not gonna I won't have time in a 45 minute session I won't have
time to go deep into creating custom ones I'll basically show it but I won't go too deep into like here's how you write
it from scratch which is what I've done before about my prior speaking experience I yeah I mean it it it requires no
knowledge about a search a because I start out with comparing aert true and aert equals to a search a and then start
building from from there so it doesn't require knowledge about a search a does require knowledge about junit but if you
have no knowledge about junit go to another session oh Arc unit uh that'll probably go on the same track though piig um
okay that was a confusing page uh okay so um what do I need Title something about better Easy right yeah that's kind of
what I was thinking is modern modern that so what would the past tense of this uh okay use let's look at the jeets let's
see how many jeets we can pull .or actually I should probably look at the releases what was in what was in how can I
stick in as many uh features as possible um they basically fall under pattern matching uh record records I think that's
it I don't think there's anything else that's that's I was thinking of sticking in the word here I don't want to say
features of obvious a lot of the talks I've seen um at conferences kind of use modern Java to indicate well sometimes
indicate anything past Java 8 which is sad because that's 10 years old um yeah so does does the whoops that was weird uh
so does the how title it feels like it does but I'm I'm opinions thank that's kind of how how I feel no pun intended but
see I want to say we we here uh like we will look at or something like that but going yeah I'm I'm I'm still undecided
feel like this is this is like SEO stuffing like how many buzzwords from java can I stuff in because I realized I also
use unnamed variables um but that feels like a much lesser feature and I'm not sure I want to I I need to call that out
I'm laughing at this yeah I'm I the how true like sadly though well okay so this is this is this is this is something
that I've been toying with for a while and I did it with the assert one is um I just did not finish editing it so that's
uh whether these talks are accepted or not um I'll be doing sort of webinar like presentations on these uh I may try to
get it at into some meetups um but if not then I will do it on my own I have my own channel I can do that um so either
way uh you will um I don't know what my elevator pitch I don't know what my elevator pitches I feel like my abstra I
don't know I'm um likely my tdd game um or the black Jack game one of the two since I don't have to decide anytime soon
uh one of those two technically the blackjack game is not a real world application although it's it's pretty
sophisticated um and does the event sourcing but probably the tdd game is is the more likely more yeah so really the the
pattern matching I mean all these the the the seal costes record record patterns pattern matching switch Expressions
those you basically it's really interesting because um it it sort of moves towards what people are calling data oriented
programming uh because you're not creating a bunch of objects with self-contained behavior and you get more more on the
side of like a visitor pattern you basically have a switch expression which is sort of looked down upon by o purists um
but I think it's appropriate yes if if it's from my tdd game we we'll get that in there you can take the head out of tdd
but then you're not left with anything or something like yeah and there's also a book uh and there was um bunch of talks
on the on yeah infoq has has often has some some good stuff and down this not an elevator pitch that's more notes I don'
t have an elevator pitch for because Ted is a great speaker I don't know uh oh my uh so tkes is talking about rails and
laravel um I I will say that there isn't one sort of out of the box here's a solid experience that can make it that you
can make applications of a certain type really fast uh Ruby rails um laravel I think those do a better job than anything
in the Java area right now um if you're writing backend API non you know not directly generating HTML kinds of things
spring boot is great I do think that going forward we'll we'll see um we'll start to see some things fit into into
spring there there's already a few things uh Thomas truy has has view components and there's some other things um I
think it's going to take a little while for it to shake out uh I there's Jay hipster which tries to um but I think there
is a case to be said that that there's a lot more there's still more spoiler plate or um lots more decisions to make uh
in the in the Java spring boot World um voden might also help in the see all right lexers get back to stuff around yeah
I don't know that play was because play was still mostly a backend framework they used to be great which was groov on uh
and Java um and again Jay hipster tries to do some of really um there is no framework for event sourcing uh at least not
that I found that doesn't try to take over I mean there's like their aspect of it that could just be a lot I don't know
I don't know I don't I I mean there's axon I think that's Overkill and and Tak and really tries to do way more than and
in a way that I find actually difficult to approach um I don't know I I I'd have to implement a bunch more events
sourced applications to see if there's need for something like that I I agree I I still think there are places where
switch statements switching over types um I I struggle with this because I think there's some places where uh we got
switch statements all over the place that's not great and why isn't that behavior inside the object um so again sort of
one one of those it and and so like I do bristle at like data oriented because I think like we've given up on on o we're
not going to have people try to do it correctly anymore I don't know that's like yeah I I'm I'm as I was saying it's
like I don't think I've done enough to see what are the commonalities that could be pulled out where that would be way
yeah I mean there so there's definitely I mean the active record pattern like Ruby rails made that super popular and for
certain types of applications you can you can get from zero to a deployed application that that does what you need it to
do really quickly um and then what as it gets more complicated as there's more Behavior yeah I think the the patterns
here in um as I said I I have to implement more applications to see what what the commonalities that could be pulled out
would be but I'm always like adopting a pet a lot of work and you're you you know it restricts you do like you can't
that you can train them pretty well but testing all right let's get this in there um I think I'm gonna leave out the the
how see what happens GNA go against my my inclination intermediate yeah all right thanks for stopping by you I'm going
to leave it his intro intermediate like just conceptually it feels like it's it's an ends framework developer these
categories are just weird uh we said core Java right yeah um what be uh because I'm a it's so weird that it would that
it that thing up again and I'm very frustrated about this I might have to go in and add that middle initial like you
know isn't this something where like you have to get five rounds of approval before anything gets pushed out I'm sure
it's some content management system but somebody just typ put it um all right so what talk do I want next I'm feeling
like this one is is like HTML framework spring framework yeah or or something yeah I mean especially since like you know
as much as deeply not uncomfortable but it's another word that I'm not conflicted uh about AI I think that's a good use
for for a more advanced spell checker that might use some large models all right swegi wish me luck uh yes I'll see you
at the software Crafters on conference yeah that's a whole other thing it's more the the grammar aspect um so like I
could the word could be spelled correctly but it's a wrong word uh that happens a lot there there there um two and two
and two uh so all the homonyms all the words that sound alike that are just the wrong word and other times just like you
you dropped a word you added you repeated a word um all those kinds of things uh and it doesn't necessarily have to be
quote you know AI or even an llm but some kind of something more than just is yes if the software crafter unconference
if you're not um I think I posted the announcements channel link uh so this conference is um it's online but it uses uh
this actually really nice interface to sort of make it easier to to be social it starts starts very early my time uh
which is 7 am so I gotta get up early but is and I've been to um a couple previous versions with that unconference
online thing it's fun and ultimately it's still you know but uh all right so all right so let's see what we can do with
this abstract yeah it's funny it's like Zoom was I think it's still in my experience um the most reliable but like now
everything it's been infected with AI that just and also what happens to companies is they have to expand uh and so they
expand into all sorts of stuff that I don't care about and not fixing the certain things that I'm blanking on so many
words today um sort of like the livability the the and the mess it since it's going to be a 45 minute talk I think it's
going to be let's start out um with a little bit of that like what uh what is architecture and why would you want to
enforce it using a tool um so I guess yes but I think mostly s yeah no I didn't sad um oh I forgot to thank sui for his
res yeah I wish there was like audio mixing capabilities period like uh I've been in many um zooms where some people are
louder than others uh and it would be nice to be able to level that across it um and having full duplex across multiple
people I don't know I mean it it's probably a hard problem but it makes for much more Awkward being able to have side
conversations is also uh really nice and and something that again you don't get with online that you only get in real
life um chat sort of makes up for that thing I mean still I mean still surprises that maybe surprise is the wrong word I
I I I think people don't understand how our tools have shaped how we interact with each other collocated yeah Zoom has
breakout rooms but it it's very awkward like you want I mean I'm I'm basically thinking like in a real collocated
everyone in the same physical place I can go did he say just what I thought he said um and it doesn't disturb everyone
and not everybody hears it and you don't have to explicitly like tap on somebody and let's go into the next room I make
a comment and we come back like that sort of Easy Flow is is lost and and just sort of that overall flow is is lost in
in online meetings because it's far too easy to to step stuff it's all it's all awkward and I just think there's not
enough focus on it like there's all these focuses on on AI and other crap that we actually don't need or it's not as
important as how do we make an online group group discussion as close to being physically there as possible now what's
interesting uh and this is totally a tangent um there are tools for uh musicians to collaborate online and you don't
have those problems because they're designed to be ultra real time and being able to hear everybody else at the same
time um and like can we take that technology and put them into the tools yeah anyway uh let's see if I can get yeah
there's all sorts of stuff that that that could be improved um but I think there's just so much more that could be done
in in sort of making the core features just more more more better I looking for donuts donuts are a valid investment do
I have a thousand word limit no I don't think I have a I I have limit um thousand words that's like a a full blog post
or reasonably lengthy blog post it's only 270 I got a ways to go characters uh can I answer to emojis I I need a I need
a word that is not a first that is not first person I want to say like we will something but I can't uh um I want say
we'll also look at um but it's like you gotta you got to write active voice um present tense but no but pronouns yeah
that's basically it's like um well it doesn't have to be active voice but it has to be present tense and there's they
tend together hey Durham um I am it is not complete yet uh it is one of the things that I will be uh now that I'm back
in gear uh that I will be starting to add damn it there's this library that I keep forgetting the name of because it's
such a weird name and every time I have to try and find the library I can never remember what the heck it is um excuse
is uh so library is uh taai um like I'm all in favor of creating libraries and languages and ecosystems and Frameworks
with names that are easily searchable but for the life of me I can never remember this name I I talk about it a lot uh
and yeah that's the flip side of it it's like let's let's create a language called anything anyway that's that's a
separate rant um did I give a talk on this specifically I know I include it talk briefly actually I don't know if I've
so all right good enough this will be my last submission framework back um no so I was just thinking because like have I
ever done that but um no because argum it is already a fluent API um I think there is a place where where using some of
assert J's capabilities would would improve things but um no they're really different different things like they're both
like Arc unit is fairly self-contained um yeah but that's a that's a that's a what oh interesting yeah and there are um
there are these so archit uh either something pretty much ported or similar types of tools are available for other
languages I don't know I don't know if there's one for the JavaScript ecosystem I those for net actually at least two
forn net uh I don't know if there's anything like that you weren't asking about that but I it all right well that took
up all the time I really kind of had a lotted for my stream today thank you um so I guess we'll we'll see we'll see how
this goes uh lesson learned for the up teth time probably good to to to take a look at the proposal submission process
um like uh before the last minute because the M the mistake I made here clearly was not having videos prepared would you
know if seeing seeing me do presentations I think is is a good I think makes it more likely that happens uh I don't
because it I end I basically backed out I basically I had gotten it my talk accepted and I basically said you with your
new format I'm not going to fly to Las Vegas on my own dime stay there on my own dime um who says on your own dime
anymore like I'm not gonna pay to fly to Las Vegas and stay there and give a session to 30 people for 30 minutes because
that's that's what happened basically they they switched it so it was that part of the conference was basically virtual
it was this weird mix of well if people happen to be here for VMware we'll have you know basically a track in a sense
for for spring and some people can come by um and I'm like I'm not doing that that's not that's that's not worth it if
they paid me to come I absolutely would have done it but I'm not going to spend $1,500 to speak for Apex uh Apex with
JavaScript oh I I that like I'm fine like I mean when I when I presented at kcdc um yes they paid for two nights at the
hotel but that's it uh I was happy to do that because I basically gave two talks um and that's totally worth it uh would
have been nicer if they had been recorded um agile be agile and Beyond uh I gave two talks and I also know the organizer
and so they paid a little bit of an honorarium but I paid my own way in I'd rather not do that but I'm I'm happy to do
that if I'm giving like full talks preferably two of them um but it's also like who else is going to be there who else
is giving talks because it's all also about like I paid last week I went to devb to next I didn't speak at all uh paid
my own way the whole the whole thing um and it was totally worth it uh because it was a lot of really good good speakers
there but when they did this the switch of the format for for the spring thing um a bunch of people you know dropped out
and and it wasn't going to be wasn't sort of dense uh this conference isn't appropriate for it but there's some uh um
conferences that just open their call for papers devox I'd love to speak at devox um there's a devox antp going on right
now or maybe just ended um and I'm definitely fomo well thanks I appreciate that all right um I think that's it for
today I was going to go look at uh the plug-in but I'm like my brain's a little fried and oh my god I've been going for
three hours anyway uh so um if you're not part of the Discord if you haven't joined the Discord please join the Discord
uh my next stream will likely be Monday say yes Monday uh I don't think I conflict with the Mets game I think Monday or
Tuesday let's go look let's go Mets uh let's go look at schedule um oh so who's gonna be is it going to be the the
Cleveland guardians or the Detroit Tigers I'm rooting for the Tigers Dan Vega is gonna kill me because he's from
Cleveland um but I'm rooting for the Tigers uh so what's the schedule um Monday's the 14th uh okay I'm not streaming
Monday because this is a one o'clock 1 pm game so I'm not streaming Monday but I'll stream Tuesday uh Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday those will be streaming days and uh other than some time in November I'm I'm hoping to get back to a full
streaming schedule of multiple streams per week um and Mike Rizzy and I will also be picking up the song themes pairing
stream so stay tuned for that uh and that's it it was great seeing you all um appreciate all the support um it's been a
rough few months but things are are we're looking better and um yeah join the Discord book clubs are resuming so a bunch
of bunch of things are getting back into into gear that's it I will see you folks next week or on the Discord have a
good one uh have a good weekend uh stay safe if you're in a weather crisis area uh
