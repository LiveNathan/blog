all right hello folk welcome to a non-coding stream although it's coding related I hope you're all doing well uh so I've
been uh working on this tdd game for a couple years now um the print and play version has been available now for
actually pretty close to a year and uh but today I've got the physical version um not print and play at home but
produced by a company called the game crafter and so they basically take your digital files and turn it into physical
product so what I'm going to do today is basically unbox the Prototype that I got so I basically had one printed out and
uh I'm assuming I'm going to find some some issues that I'll have to to clean up but um we'll we'll see how that goes so
let me switch over to my camera my overhead camera so what I've got here is sitting on top of the physical box is the
print and play version so the print and play you basically download the digital files you print it on a hopefully color
printer slice and dice things up maybe put them on a on a thicker thicker backing or put them in in these uh sleeves and
then you can you can play the game and I've had people from all the world play it and the reason I created it was to
teach people sort of just the process and the flow of test driven development but also some of the consequences when you
do things like skip tests or skip other aspects of the test driven development cycle so let's get to it so the look is
the same the pretty much the the graphic files are the the same this is a pretty big box so it turns out that I wasn't
quite sure of the size of the box that I needed so I basically ordered two boxes so there's probably another box inside
this box um so I need to figure out which box size can hold all the elements because then I can actually have the box
printed so right now these are blank boxes but the the production run will will have a the basically this logo pretty
much printed over the over the whole top so what unwrap it the same a bit nervous because like you never know like what
did I do wrong when I when I uploaded the files what did I miss so all right and lo and behold there's um oh throw the
wrapping yeah so here these are the this is why I think I need the bigger box because when they print it um these are
printed on eight and a half by eleven very thick tile you know cart not just playing cardstock but like thick now like a
couple millimeters thick uh cardboard and so they won't I don't think they will punch it out for me because if you punch
them out then it can fit in this in this smaller box so clearly everything else fits in the smaller box um except for
this and this is why I think I have to decide how I'm gonna gonna do that I could have them print up just a bunch of
copies and then I re-box them I might do that because really the big boxes is such a waste which is kind of what I
figure so these are the hex tile cars these are these these look good let's open that up they say uh supposed to smell
like a little bit of smoky because they are laser cut and lasers and paper tend to tend to have a little bit of a smoky
smell uh I could have the small box before yeah I mean they have to ship it and so I I mean honestly I don't anticipate
I'm gonna get like hundreds of orders so um like if I get 20 30 orders which is sort of what I expect I'm totally fine
with with re-boxing it myself so uh these are also these are very shiny these are really nice and they're they are quite
thick so there's there's some I have to figure out because basically each what they call plug I forget all these
different terminology so each each slug has six tiles and so there aren't 12 tiles in the game they're only ten so it's
a side note like uh these are really shiny these are UV coated they're very very smooth but it looks like I need a
little bit more uh what's called a bleed on the edge here on the back because you shouldn't see any of any of the white
so I'll have to fix that but anyway so there's basically two blank two two blank tiles and I I feel like it's such a
waste I'm paying for it doesn't cost much more to for them to print those two tiles and I feel like it's a waste if I
don't so I'm gonna figure out what to fill them up with so this is another game Tile game tile this is the back of the
game tile um and so there's just the slightest that I have these are a little bit of white there um but this is this
came out really nice I have to say this I am I'm very happy I was worried about because like some of the stuff and uh
your hands will get dirty and so this is the thing where maybe I want to re-rebox just so people don't get their hands
dirty literally yeah exactly I think I'm gonna re-box it I I don't I would feel silly with such a big box and and once
you actually undo it it totally fits in a smaller box plus the smaller box is cheaper cheaper to cheaper to buy cheaper
to print and then the whole thing is cheaper to ship shipping this stuff ain't cheap it's not so bad uh in within the us
we're on base but shipping internationally not cheap so apologies in advance for those of you who are not in in the US
we finished undoing these so these pop out pretty pretty nicely like these are really clean cut um there's just like the
slightest and boy look at my hands they're really dirty yeah so I I definitely feel like I want to re-box if nothing
else to just to get the the drip off so these are really these are like solid these are these are these are a great
weight for for these because these will form the board all right so let's put that over here um I think I can get rid of
this box now because that's not even all right so now now I got the smaller box so uh let's lay out the board so one of
the things in the game is part sort of the initial part of the game is figuring out what is the correct order right so
this again I created this game to help people sort of memorize the the order of of doing things in in tdd and uh so this
is sort of the the and the answer key is shows you the correct setup for the board um otherwise it basically sits and
sits in the center so I'll set that up in a second hey squeegee I don't know if I want to do that much work the savings
of sort of optimizing the number of tiles for the for the hex um is on the order of about 30 cents per game I'm not sure
if it's worth optimizing that way because then if I want a an odd number of games I don't think it's worth optimizing
that I'll have to think of something else though to put on the blank tiles I could print extras of something I don't
know open to other ideas if I got into production where like for some bizarre reason lots of people wanted it once you
get up to like a couple of hundred games it's worth going to a completely different process hey yeah tdd coaster there
you go and there's the instruction manual so these are all the cards these look really nice I'm gonna not touch them
just yet uh and so to play the game you um you need to die a six-sided die uh you also need markers for players those
are also cheap so I sort of designed this as a two player game but I know people who played three player uh you could
probably play four player I don't know that there's any limit the cards you'd probably be shuffling more often but I'm
probably going to include a different an additional player um and then there are these sort of see-through tokens which
are uh actually nice they're much thicker than I thought I'll open up that in a second yes it would be it would be cute
to really extend like and yes if I went into like you know massive volume where I could have a custom designed figure
the the little little hamster as as the playing pieces would be cute it's actually a guinea pig which is where Jitter
Pig came from was inspired by guinea pigs anyway looks and this is one of those things where I'm gonna give it a read
and I'm sure I will find a typo although I have proofed it several times and I've have had several dozen customers
although I never know if people actually read the the manual you kind of need to so this is this is perfect this is nice
printed everything fit so the I always have to look at like you know is did the page number get cut off no that looks
good the little little logo at the top get cut off you know yeah that looks that looks great and so these are the pieces
and these are the cards which ages of the board game for I mean the game is actually I've played so I played when I
tested test played this game I test played it with people who are not coders at all who were just Gamers and they
thought it was fun so it it works on it's just fun and it would work for any age I mean it you know you you basically
have cards and as long as you can read it's totally totally any any age oh yeah totally a nine-year-old yeah absolutely
so these are the cards oh these are so I have to say it like the UV coating is really nice these are really shiny very
smooth um which means they're also gonna be easy to clean and I guess I'll just rip off though thing so very very solid
and so these are so there are two kinds of cards in in the game well three kinds of cards there's what are called test
result cards that's these uh so these are the test results cards these are sort of take you through the game um and
these came out really not I have to say I'm I'm just like really thrilled at how how good this came out I'm I'm it's
it's so tedious to get the files set up just right and so I'm really happy that that it worked out so these are all the
and more test results cards and add more action cards I don't know how these get printed so whatever or they're in it's
test result cards and then action cards well the other thing I wanted to I was curious about is um the bleeds there's
the so can assert card less code code blow less code uh where's my right code cards is my predict foreign Factor there
it is so it's interesting that uh this write code the letters actually don't come up to quite quite the edge um which is
fine uh when I designed it it looked like it was going to get right at the edge which was also fine because that was
part of the design these are these are really nice I'm assuming they're the correct number I'm not going to count them
then there's also in addition to the action cards themselves there's the basically the tracking your score so there are
two things that you track in the game and I'll lay that out let's see where's the other one so basically you score based
on on commits and that's what the little that's what these little things are for uh these little translucent things is
your sport tracker so I'll do that in a second there's supposed to be two they're supposed to be um two of these I don't
see the others did I get that wrong all right well there's my first bug apparently because these are all the test
results cards apparently I printed the wrong number of of scoring cards all right well that's that's a that's a major
major problem so now I have to go look at the look at the order see what happened there now to see like did I make the
mistake or did they make the mistake I'm sure it was me yeah I lost my wand the interesting thing about this game though
is you could actually play solo so yeah so this this this box is actually uh the perfect size once everything is sort of
broken down see so let's put that aside see so these yeah these are really looks good uh these I'll have to shuffle I'm
not gonna shuffle them right now I actually wanted to get these um these things which you basically place over uh you
know to figure out where where you are um I wanted to get them as as hexagon shaped uh except that's really expensive
because because it's so unique so I decided I I have to see again if I can get those um get those printed as hexagons
the other thing is I I so this this playing piece looks pretty good this is the black playing piece this looks pretty
good this one I don't know what the heck happened here like I don't know if you can see it but it's actually kind of in
bad shape so that'll be another reason I and this is one of those things it's like if I'm gonna box it myself there's
always the option although there's a balance between like do I how much work do I do to sort of optimize you know
sourcing of of the stuff um the other thing is I think these are probably okay for so code risk when you go through the
game you basically you can build up risk if you uh skip skip some steps um I think I might have to make these hexagons a
bit bigger so that it's clear these are for for the commets uh these are actually kind of dark you can still see the
number through it that these are I might have to go with a different color because these are it may look black but this
is actually like a translucent green but I think it's a bit too dark so I'll have to I might have to swap out some of
those colors so I'll probably do another prototype print to give me a couple of I think I'll print um I'm going to
probably throw in extra extra of these cards anyway because I think if you want three or four players again it's it's 50
60 cents extra so which means a dollar for you um I think it's worth uh with a dollar uh and then not thrilled with the
quality of these even the black one is it's because it's wood um I might I might pick something else for that but
otherwise the cards are the cards are perfect no complaints about the cards the hex tiles I gotta fix the the bleed so
if you can see so you see the white on the edge I gotta fix that um but otherwise uh and then I'd have to include extras
of these these are not too expensive that out there yeah so I'll figure out something else for those so in terms of the
gameplay what you do is you let's see this is that it's not going to Center uh this goes first what should it do you
know it didn't then this goes oops here so this goes in the center so you write the codes to the test compiles you then
you right code for the future so this is the the layout of the board and so this is the way uh this is the way you play
and you basically start and and you draw you draw five Cards into your hand so your hand always has five cards and when
you want to move from space to Pace sometimes you need to just discard so the first two steps are sort of the idea of in
tdd if I figure out well what should it do what what's the new thing you wanted to do what's the behavior right what's
the behavior changes I have on my hat and then you discard and uh you basically have two actions per turn so then you
discard again and you probably end up here and so you could skip all the way to here and the way that that gets
accounted for is then that builds up kodra so that adds a plus three risk and so you basically put that here and so you
build up you build up risk and the risk cap and the risk matters is a commit code uh should the center card have a have
a blue border well so what happens is is when you once you set it up you basically can but I might I might put a I might
put a bleed I could do that hey that's what I could do with the extra tiles is I could have a couple of experiments
because I know I'll have to I'll have to reprint it and so you could you could take the risky route and then you you go
basically you go around faster but once you get to commit code if you've got risk you've gotta roll a die which is this
one you're a six-sided die note how the die is red and if you roll it and you get a one well that really sucks for you
because now you basically have to discard your hand and in a sense you basically start over and you get no commit points
and so you're you're down here and so you can decide to take on risk or you can play it safe uh and exit so you have to
have specific cards to exit so here you basically play right code card and then when you have to predict so test fail is
expected that's the prediction and that's what these test result cards are all about you draw a card and it might say
something like as predicted if you've got two or more less code cards in play so there's the idea that you want to play
less code cards right because when you're doing tdd you want to write less code to try and make your your test pass the
least amount of code you can get away with and so the less so you write code but you also need to have less code and
then there are these uh blocker cards like uh can assert and code bloat and these slow you down uh you it might require
you to have a refactor card in order to to take down some of your risk or to get yourself out of out of a stuck
situation and so I think it's a fun game I'm not the only one and it's also really useful I think for for discussing uh
discussing tdd when is it might be appropriate to take on some risk and say you know we're gonna we're gonna skip skip
this part and go a little bit faster but eventually that that speed will catch up with you and eventually you'll max out
your risk and it will be very unlikely that you'll be able to to commit and that's very much I think reflective of of
real life coding so that's it other than a goof on my port where uh I didn't print enough of these some minor issues
around the the borders on the on the back of the hextiles the kind of not great player pieces I'm really pleased and so
I'll basically today or tomorrow fix up the the mistakes I've made uh or the things I want to adjust probably print up
another couple of prototypes because I do have some folks who are running meetups uh and they wanted they wanted some
copies for them to play it as a group it'll probably take a four or five weeks to get the the updates on those but at
that point I'll open up for for pre-orders once once I get those so that'll happen probably in in like three or four
weeks so that's all I've got for you today I gotta say there's there's there's something about having the physical
version of of the game and it it looking pretty much what I the way I wanted it to look that is is I have to say it's
quite satisfying and now that I know the box size the the Box itself will be printed with with the game information name
logo and so yeah so watch out for for pre-orders a warning shipping is gonna not be cheap but once I get those
pre-orders in I'll cut off and then I'll be able to place an order and I'll I'll be shipping it myself because I'm going
to re-box it all right uh thanks for hanging out folks I appreciate it appreciate all the comments don't forget if you'
re not already signed up on the lists and you want to find out about uh the pre-orders go to td.cards for those of you
who've purchased the print and play digital version you're going to get a coupon for a little bit off of of the physical
game just to thank you for for buying the the digital version all right so That's all folks thanks a lot I'll see you at
some point for an actual coding stream but for now thanks a lot and I will see you next time
